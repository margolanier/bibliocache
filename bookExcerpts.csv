52, [The children were the worst; whereas Delanian children we as meek and quiet as the music of the Old Gods, Xeeonite children were loud and dirty, crossing the streets at random, causing vehicles to blare their horns when they got in their paths, even mocking the robotic law enforcers that protected this city from crime.]
56, [His words come out a stuttering croak—the sound of a door creaking and juddering against its frame. The three Chinese men—the old cinder block with the caterpillar eyebrows, his attache with the razor-sharp line of a mouth, and the translator—stare at him as if he's got a third eye]
62, [Mindless we lived and mindless we loved, and mindless at last we died; and deep in a rift of the Caradoc drift we slumbered side by side. The world turned on in the lathe of time, the hot lands heaved amain, till we caught our breath from the womb of death, and crept into light again.]
64, [Teenagers lazily come in groups to the main entrance of the only local middle school, a new three-story building with pretty well maintained flowerbeds and freshly colored low hedgerow. It was September, the first day after the weekend.]
70, [The only part of him one could spot with certainty was his head, which was that of an otter-hound. This piece of penetration was not my own, but that of a friend. For, at the time Blizzard came to me, I had never kept a dog; nor had I any intention of doing so.]
72, [The girl read the advertisement for the twentieth time, then dropped the newspaper upon the shabbily ornate center table center table with a shrug of impatience, a frown gathering between her level brows. The boarding house parlor was shrouded in gloom, and outside the window whirling snowflakes showed white against the deepening dusk.]
77, [She turned in the fog as one more person, caught among the fallen rocks, cried out to her. She came face to face with a woman — blood congealed in her hair and streaked down the side of her face, a chunk of concrete crushing her legs. She begged Jade to find her son.]
81, [It had taken Cassie all of ten seconds after seating herself at the bar to realize just how big a mistake she'd made in coming to a bar owned by one of Providence's most notorious crime bosses. When you walk through fire, you get burned. With all the stares she'd gotten just walking across the floor, she felt like burnt toast.]
86, [Tom Blake, sprawled on his front with his eye to a hole in the floorboards, counted four men. Three were lithe and wiry with hard faces, dark clothes, and tatted arms. The fourth was short and fat, with a belly that hung over his belt, and rolls of flab that rippled down his neck where his head morphed into his shoulders.]
91, [If the girl was trying to avoid being seen, she was doing a brilliantly poor job. When I stopped, she stopped. When I started again, so did she. Aged in her twenties, her appearance was pure corn-fed American. She was dressed in vacation mode — white tee and short pink shorts — and there was a swing to her walk.]
95, [As young children they had been close friends, learning to ride their bikes together, playing in the street every day, and in and out of each other's houses. But by the time they hit their teens they had gone different ways. Holly knew she was fairly invisible at school.]
97, [I rushed to get dressed, stepping into my pyjamas bottoms and throwing on a black vest. I glanced at the clock on my mantelpiece. 9 PM. The night was still young but I felt drained. I rubbed my hair with a towel. Coming out of the room, I noticed Kat hovering by the home phone.]
99, [I adjust my breather, the half-mask that covers my mouth and nose. I can still feel her looking at me, so I check the tank strapped to my side. Still plenty of oxygen. "Vikka, tell me! Don't you ever wonder what's up there?" "The Dome." This is a good answer, a safe answer, but not the one she wants to hear.]
100, [Spiritual relations were conceded to England at that favored period, as at this. Mrs. Southcott had recently attained her five-and-twentieth blessed birthday, of whom a prophetic private in the Life Guards had heralded the sublime appearance by announcing that arrangements were made for the swallowing up of London and Westminster.]
123, [Dazzled by the occasional glare of the lamps, buffetted by the wind and rain, and sometimes involved in what, comparatively, might be called total obscurity, she at length stumbled and fell, uttering a plaintive cry, which, however the sound of a passing carriage, and the turbulence of the blast, united in preventing her friends from hearing.]
