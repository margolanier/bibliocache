24, [The children were the worst; whereas Delanian children we as meek and quiet as the music of the Old Gods, Xeeonite children were loud and dirty, crossing the streets at random, causing vehicles to blare their horns when they got in their paths, even mocking the robotic law enforcers that protected this city from crime. Where were their parents? Did all the Xeeonite parents abdicate their parental responsibility once their children reached a certain age? Mine own parents certainly would not have tolerated such rudeness. Not that my opinion of the robotic law enforcers themselves was much higher.]
28, [His words come out a stuttering croak—the sound of a door creaking and juddering against its frame. The three Chinese men—the old cinder block with the caterpillar eyebrows, his attache with the razor-sharp line of a mouth, and the translator—stare at him as if he's got a third eye. "We have questions," the translator says. He's not translating anything yet — the other two haven't spoken aloud, not today. They chattered plenty when they pulled him out of Moscow, though the translator didn't do much translating then.]
35, [Mindless we lived and mindless we loved, and mindless at last we died; and deep in a rift of the Caradoc drift we slumbered side by side. The world turned on in the lathe of time, the hot lands heaved amain, till we caught our breath from the womb of death, and crept into light again. We were Amphibians, scaled and tailed and drab as a dead man's hand; we coiled at ease 'neath the dripping trees, or trailed through the mud and sand, croaking and blind, with out three-clawed feet. Writing a language dumb, with never a spark in the empty dark to hint at a life to come.]
37, [Teenagers lazily come in groups to the main entrance of the only local middle school, a new three-story building with pretty well maintained flowerbeds and freshly colored low hedgerow. It was September, the first day after the weekend. No one wanted to sit in the stuffy classroom and listen to the long lectures. A cup of hot tea and nice sleep till rain's end were almost everyone's dreams. The teenagers, especially the girls, gathered into groups or pairs, complaining loudly about weather, spoiled makeup and unruly wet hair.]
43, [The only part of him one could spot with certainty was his head, which was that of an otter-hound. This piece of penetration was not my own, but that of a friend. For, at the time Blizzard came to me, I had never kept a dog; nor had I any intention of doing so. A slim curate of some six years' standing, not very tall, powerful, or sporting, in my cloth boots, what had I to do with dogs? As I mean to make a clean breast of the extraordinary confusions, and uprootings of habits and ideas which the well-named Blizzard brought into my life, I may as well sat that, at the time I first met him, I detested the whole of his tribe, from the Mastiff to the Maltese, and wondered why the nasty creatures were made such a fuss of.]
13, [All at once she paused tense and alert with lifted chin and quickened breath. The throbbing purr of a motor had pulsed upon the stillness of the snow enwrapped street, and halted with a dull grinding of brakes before the door. She darted to the window and peered eagerly out between the dingy curtains. A massive limousine stood at the curb, its bulk looming blackly against the lesser darkness, with broad diagonal lines of white striping the lower body, and a rakish torpedo shaped hood. It was just such a car as a person of somewhat bizarre taste and the wealth with which to gratify it might have chosen, yet had it been a veritable juggernaut its effect upon the girl could have been no more sinister.]
20, [Jade Hensen twisted in the cool sheets. Her sweaty panicked body search for a way out of the endless nightmare of bloated bodies, desperate people and cries for help — pleas that would never get answered. She turned in the fog as one more person, caught among the fallen rocks, cried out to her. She came face to face with a woman — blood congealed in her hair and streaked down the side of her face, a chunk of concrete crushing her legs. She begged Jade to find her son. Screaming, Jade took off to the safety of the tent, the tent filled with the dead… and the living that searched for their families.]
8, [Tom Blake, sprawled on his front with his eye to a hole in the floorboards, counted four men. Three were lithe and wiry with hard faces, dark clothes, and tatted arms. The fourth was short and fat, with a belly that hung over his belt, and rolls of flab that rippled down his neck where his head morphed into his shoulders. 'Names!' the fat man screamed. The figure in the chair muttered something inaudible and his interrogator swung a clenched fist so hard into the knot of his stomach that it made Blake wince. 'Who are you working for?' asked the overweight brute.]
62, [As young children they had been close friends, learning to ride their bikes together, playing in the street every day, and in and out of each other's houses. But by the time they hit their teens they had gone different ways. Holly knew she was fairly invisible at school. She had strawberry blond hair that she kept pulled back lest it tend to curl, and an ordinary face. She just didn't stand out in any way. She always felt utterly nondescript and dull, especially surrounded by some of the fashion-plate girls that were in her year.]
64, ['You need to come home,' Leo ordered. Kat's eyes popped out of her head as Leo stretched. His tight shirt lifted to reveal toned, tanned abs. Her gaze roamed over his arms and landed on his blond hair. I crossed my arms as he strutted into the flat, showing off his tattoos. 'I don't want to come home.' I was adamant. He took my elbow gently and looked down into my eyes. 'You can't stay here, Pisces. Kat Knows.' He turned to look at Kat. His previous cockiness had gone. A flash of something crossed his face. I wondered what he wasn't telling me. I was being difficult but I needed my freedom. All my life I had been around eleven other people, and although I begged for space, the boys never gave me any. 'Quit the small talk. You've been compromised.']
86, [Few persons were about, and the stairs by which they ascended were obscurely lighted, and evidently destined for the use of the domestics. On the second floor, they came to a long passage, with doors opening in separate rooms on each side. One of the furthest of these, the stranger cautiously, but without knocking, opened, and instantly turning and locking it after him, advanced with his trembling companion towards a table, on which lights were burning and at which sat a lady still young and rather pretty, reading. The room was carpeted, and having but momentarily raiser her eyes on his approach, she neither heard nor saw the little stranger, till pointing towards her with one hand, whilst with the other he still securely held her, he said in a subdued voice — 'Mary look! — but hush!' The lady hastily cast a glance as he directed, and starting forward in extreme agitation, exclaimed.]
93, [For a small one, "Oh" is a very expressive word. But whether this particular one signified impatience, or, as Nattie sensitively feared, contempt for her abilities, she could not tell. But certain it was that "X n" sent along the letters now, in such a slow, funereal procession that she was driven half frantic with nervousness in the attempt to piece them together into words. They had not proceeded far, however, before a small, thin voice fell upon the ears of the agitated Nattie. "Are you taking a message now?" it asked. Nattie glanced over her shoulder, and saw a sharp, inquisitive nose, a green veil, a pair of eye-glasses, and a strained smile, sticking through her little window.]
87, [To yesterday and today I say my polite "vaya used con Dios." What are these days to me? But that far-off day of my romance when from between the blue and white bales in Don Ramon's darkened storeroom, at Kingston, I saw the door open before the figure of an old man with the tired, long, white face, that day I am not likely to forget. I remember the chilly smell of the typical West Indian store, the indescribable smell of damp gloom, of locos, of pimento, of olive oil, of new sugar, of new rum; the glassy double sheen of Ramon's great spectacles, the piercing eye of the mahogany face, while the tap, tap, tap of a cane on the flags went on behind the inner door; the click of the latch; the stream of light. The door, petulantly thrust inwards, struck against some barrels.]
9, [He listened as the voice spoke. Soon, he had that feeling he used to get — the feeling that his stomach was in an elevator rapidly descending fifty stories. Perhaps this was why he had quit his job. Not because of too many close calls, not because his son was growing up so fast, but because he didn't like this feeling in his stomach. It was the knowing that made him sick. The knowing was too much. He thought of the millions of people out there, living their happy lives, blissfully unaware of what was going on. Luke envied their ignorance.]
103, [The discovery of America by Columbus, and of the northern continent by the Cabots, in the fifteenth century, and the several voyages of the English and French, in the sixteenth, I pass over, and begin with the voyage made by Batholomew Gosnold, an Englishman, in the year 1602, to that part of North America since called New England. It is not certain that any European had been there before. Hackluit mentions the landing of some of Sir H Gilbert's mean upon some part of the continent; but, it is probable, that was farther eastward, upon what is now called Nova Scotia. Gosnold landed adrift on the eastern coast, which he calls Mavoshen. After some commerce with that natives, he sailed southwad, and landed upon one of the islands called Elizabeth islands.]
100, [Richard Campbell was one of a family of ten children, but all have now passed away. He attended school in New York and when a youth of about fifteen years began working for others in the Empire state, residing in Chittenango. In the year 1856 he came with his brother, John Campbell, to Iowa. They made their way westward by rail to Dubuque and thence by wagon to Independence. The hauled the lumber from Dubuque to build their home and became actively identified with the material development and progress of this part of the state. Following his arrival Richard Campbell began loaning money and later conducted the First National Bank, of which he became the first president, so continuing to the time of his death.]
73, [For unbridled passions, defiant self-will, arrogant contempt of the received order of things and of the world's opinion, associated with high endowments and much resolute energy of character, formed the inauspicious inheritance, which, in full measure, accumulated on the head of the poet. Of this Byron was conscious, and repeatedly expressed it. 'Some curse' — he writes, in a letter to his friend Davies on the death of his mother — 'hangs over me and mine.' He was nevertheless proud, to an extraordinary degree, of his descent, prouder, it has been said, than of his works. He laid great stress on his being of a Norman not of a Saxon family, and lost no opportunity of asserting it; nor, strange to say, was his pride in any wise ruffled by the undeniable blot in his genealogical tree, indicated in his escutcheon by the 'bordure,' the sign of illegitimacy.]
69, [It was a one-sided love affair, the brief courtship of Jane Lampton and John Marshall Clemens. All her life, Jane Clemens honored her husband, and while he lived served him loyally; but the choice of her heart had been a young physician of Lexington with whom she had quarreled, and her prompt engagement with John Clemens was a matter of temper rather than tenderness. She stipulated that the wedding take place at once, and on May 6, 1823, they were married. She was then twenty; her husband twenty-five. More than sixty years later, when John Clemens had long been dead, she took a railway journey to a city where there was an old Settlers' Convention, because among the names of those attending she had noticed the name of the lover of her youth.]
68, [The sun had dropped behind the Goldure Range, the mellow light beloved of the highest earthborn kinds was on the bid world of hill and view, and, like the hidden lights of the banquet-hall, its glow from the western cornice of the sky diffused a soft, shadowless radiance in the lesser vales. High on a hill that sloped to the Shawn from the west was a little piney glade. It was bright with the many flowers of this the Song-moon time; it was lovely and restful in the neither-sun-nor-shade, but its chief interest lay in this — it was the home of a family of Foxes. The den door was hidden in the edge of the pine thicket, but the family was out now in the open, to romp and revel in the day's best hour. The mother was there, the central figure of the group, the stillest, and yet the most tensely alive.]
63, [The bus driver frowned at Sly in the rearview mirror. Today Joe was wearing a T-shirt that advertised his hot-air balloon business. As the bus doors squealed shut, she fantasized about stealing the rainbow-striped balloon and drifting away to wherever the wind blew. Maybe to wherever her father was. Tony shuffled to the back of the bus. The bus lurched into motion, away from the school. She checked her watch. She'd broken her phone and, as punishment, her mother was forcing her to live in the ice age— sans phone. Twenty-three minutes, six stops, and she would have survived another day. Better than that, it was the beginning of spring break.]
51, [All the world over, I wonder, in lands that I never have trod, Are the people eternally seeking for the signs and steps of a God? Westward across the ocean, and Northward across the snow, Do they all stand gazing, as ever, and what do the wisest know? Here, in this mystical India, the deities hover and swarm like the wild bees heard in the tree-tops, or the gusts of a gathering storm; in the air men hear their voices, their feet on the rocks are seen, yet we all day, "Whence is the message, and what may the wonders mean?' A million shrines stand open, and ever the censer swings, as they bow to a mystic symbol, or the figures of ancient kings; and the incense rises ever, and rises the endless cry of those who are heavy laden, and of cowards loth to die.]
46, [This First Book proposes, first in brief, the whole subject—Man’s disobedience, and the loss thereupon of Paradise, wherein he was placed: then touches the prime cause of his fall—the Serpent, or rather Satan in the Serpent; who, revolting from God, and drawing to his side many legions of Angels, was, by the command of God, driven out of Heaven, with all his crew, into the great Deep. Which action passed over, the Poem hastes into the midst of things; presenting Satan, with his Angels, now fallen into Hell—described here not in the Centre (for heaven and earth may be supposed as yet not made, certainly not yet accursed), but in a place of utter darkness, fitliest called Chaos. Here Satan, with his Angels lying on the burning lake, thunderstruck and astonished after a certain space recovers, as from confusion; calls up him who, next in order and dignity, lay by him: they confer of their miserable fall. Satan awakens all his legions, who lay till then in the same manner confounded. They rise: their numbers; array of battle; their chief leaders named, according to the idols known afterwards in Canaan and the countries adjoining.]
57, [Instinct and compulsion drove Sinjin's lean, teenage body to greater speed, his shoulder-length auburn hair streaming behind him. Running was the one thing he did well, and the landscape slid by in a blur punctuated by moments of perfect focus. Leaping over a protruding tree root, his eyes locked on another dark-robed figure moving within the trees. Startled, Sinjin lost his step and nearly went down, but through strength of will, he heeded his father's command and ran. Ahead the trail turned sharply upward on a direct course to the top of a steep incline.]
21, [A cutting wind whipped around the cars in the deserted parking lot, blowing late autumn leaves past Jake's feet. Winter intended to visit Columbus, Ohio early this year. Two more weeks and Thanksgiving would arrive. Jake doubted he'd be around to give thanks for anything. But for now the cold worked to his advantage. The security guards stuck close to the hospital entrances. Not one patrol passed where he and his witness sat hidden between two pickup trucks. A soft moan drew his attention to the boy resting against the car beside him. Nicky was fading quickly.]
25, [She's a pretty young half-asian, maybe 28, and I can't imagine what she's doing out here in the skulks. She came in to my graysmithy building an hour ago with a hunted look in her eyes, asking or a very specific inject: a hand-made combination of languages and vocational skills. It's plain she's running from something, but it isn't the job of a gray smith to ask questions. I steadily depress the syringe plunger, injecting its silvery contents into her brain. It's dangerous stuff, enough to radically change her brain content and chemistry, but she doesn't seem too phased.]
